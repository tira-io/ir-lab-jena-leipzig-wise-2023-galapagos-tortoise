System Name: galapagos-tortoise-rank-zephyr
Description (short description of the system):
LLM-based re-ranking of BM25 top-1000 with RankZephyr.

************
System Details. Please provide as many details as possible here, so it is possible to reproduce your run.

Ranking Methods (Which ranking approaches does the system use?): RankZephyr
Data Used (Which data were used to train and fine-tune the system? Please be as concrete as possible and use the exact reference whenever possible): Model was used as-is.
Software Used (Which software and tools did you use for training, tunning and running your system? Please be as concrete as possible, provide a reference to your code if possible, and provide the exact software version, whenever applicable): TIRA (0.0.129), PyTerrier (0.10.0)
Pre-processing and Indexing (What pre-processing and indexing does the system use? Please be as concrete as possible and provide the details and the setup of the tools): None
System Combination / Fusion (Does the system combine different retrieval models? If so, how are they combined?): No
Multi-stage Retrieval (Is system single-stage or does it use reranking? If multi-stage, which rerankers are used?): All models are used as re-rankers of a BM25 candidate retrieval (top-1000).
Translations (Does the system use French documents or the translations? If translations, which ones?): English

Resources (How much GPU, CPU, memory, ... did you use for pre-processing and inference steps? Did you use any commercial cloud services?): Run used from TIRA cache.
The Costs (How long did pre-processing and inference take?): 10 minutes
